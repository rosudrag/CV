Professional Experience
2015 - 2016  Code ComputerLove - Software Developer:
            Part of team of the year 2015 in Code, I&#8217;ve been a valuable asset for the company since
            day one. I&#8217;ve predominately worked on a .NET website project for an important client.
          &#x2219; Methodology:  Worked in an Agile, Lean environment with Scrum meetings and TDD
            as development method.  I&#8217;ve adapted easily to the numerous method changes we were
            experimenting with and got accustomed to trying new things on daily basis.
          &#x2219; Continuous  Integration:  Improved  pipeline  with  Teamcity,  Octopus  and  Jenkins  by
            setting up new environments and hooking up to a statistics framework.
          &#x2219; Measurements:  Developed dashboards for our projects that provided us with visibility
            of any failures that might occur. By hooking up statistics to the dashboards I&#8217;ve generated
            a screen that could pinpoint fluctuations in profit to the software changes.

            Put in practice the techniques taught at University to quickly grasp the technologies the
            company used and made myself a real asset for the team.
          &#x2219; CIVICA best team nomination: Came second place at best team awards in the company
            and I would like to think I played an important role in this.

Education
2011 - 2015  The University of Manchester
            BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Industrial Experience
            Degree result 2:1          Overall results: 63%
          &#x2219; Developed  an  excellent  IT  foundation  by  combining  the  skills  and  knowledge  taught
            at University with practical experience.  Regularly worked in small size teams to plan,
            design and develop projects, employing agile and pair programming techniques.
          &#x2219; Enhanced my algorithmic thinking through participation in challenging events and com-
            petitions.
          &#x2219; Progressed my ability to view a problem through different perspectives and the skill to
            combine them in order to produce a solution that will benefit all the involved parties.
Manchester Ultimate Programming and achievement:
            Conducted weekly presentations throughout the year and organised one 24 hour hackathon.
            I&#8217;ve managed to put my networking skills into practice to acquire sponsorship for prizes
            and catering.
          &#x2219; Most Innovative technical approach award: Awarded at the &#8221;Open Source Hackathon&#8221;
            where I Teamed with a PhD student to create a project called &#8221;Group My contacts&#8221;. My
            suggestion to using pair programming with the Cloud9 IDE had given us a velocity ad-
            vantage which allowed us to merge multiple APIs that analysed and produced curious
            social groups through Facebook and Twitter contact analysis.
          &#x2219; Leadership:  Through hard work and dedication I worked my way up the hierarchy of
            the society and became the chairman of it. I managed to boost the events turnout and the
            attendance number had doubled by the end of the year.

Voluntary work
       Helping others has always been in my nature so I became both a PASS Leader and a Student
       Helper. The outcome was a big bonus for me as these activities shaped me into a better person,
       more empathetic and able to relate and help others with their issues.
          &#x2219; PASS Leader: Pear assisted study sessions is a student support scheme where new stu-
            dents have the opportunity to interact with their peers. I acted as a facilitator and a mentor
            to my group steering them in the right directions, helping them find the right resources
            and develop the ability to overcome problems.
          &#x2219; Student Helper: Represented and presented the University in a real and positive view to
            both students interested in higher education and their parents.
