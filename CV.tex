	\begin{itemize}
	\item[] In an Agile development environment, I have been working on projects involving data analysis on UK council data. Notable Projects include:
  \item[-] Creating Kubernetes environments, containerizing existing applications, and developing microservices. I successfully migrated from expensive on-premise servers to a cloud-based Kubernetes infrastructure, reducing costs and increasing scalability.
  \item[-] Creating search engine app on ElasticSearch with advanced relevancy scoring and geolocation filtering. Reimplementing the SQL searches into ElasticSearch resulted in very accurate results with less required input from users, improving the customer satisfaction and attracting more clients.
\item[-] Established CI/CD templates and pipelines for all the apps, improving the efficiency and speed of the development process.
\item[-] Upgraded all the applications from .Net Framework 3/4 to .Net Core and configured container builds for them.
	\item \textbf{Technologies:} .Net Framework / Core, C\#, Kubernetes, Docker, ElasticSearch, Node, ReactJS, RedisDB, Hangfire, Data8.
