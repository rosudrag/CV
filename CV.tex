\section{\bf 2011 - 2015 \hspace{1.5mm}The University of Manchester}
  
  \begin{itemize} % \item[] to prevent a bullet from appearing
     \item[] BSc (Hons) Computer Science  with Industrial Experience
     \item[] Degree result 2:1 \hspace{10mm}Overall results: 63\% 

     \item Developed an excellent IT foundation by combining the skills and knowledge taught
     at University with practical experience.
     \item Regularly worked in small size teams to plan, design and develop projects,   employing techniques such as agile and pair programming.
     \item Further improved my algorithmic thinking by participating in challenging puzzle solving events and competitions.
     \item Acquired the ability to view a problem through different perspectives: the client, developer and investor view and also the skill to combine them in order to produce a solution that will benefit all the involved parties.
   \end{itemize}

\section{\bf Manchester Ultimate Programming and achievement:}
\vspace{5mm}    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item[] Conducted around 20 presentations. Organised one 24 hour hackathon where I managed to put my networking skills into practice to acquire sponsorship for prizes and catering.
    \item{\bf Most Innovative technical approach award:} Awarded at the "Open Source Hackathon". Teamed with a PhD student to create a project called "Group My contacts". I suggested using pair programming with the Cloud9 IDE and git on the separate tasks. Analysed various issues that arose when trying to bind the work together and quickly pinpointed them out and devised a common solution.

      \item {\bf Leadership:} Through hard work and dedication I worked my way up the hierarchy of the society and became the chairman of it. The events turnout had doubled as result.
     \end{itemize}
\newpage
\section{\large\bf Voluntary work}
\vspace{2mm}
Helping others has always been in my nature so I became both a PASS Leader and a Student Helper.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item {\bf PASS Leader:} Pear assisted study sessions is a student support scheme where new students have the opportunity to interact with their peers. I acted as a facilitator and a mentor to my group steering them in the right directions, helping them find the right resources and develop the ability to overcome problems.
      \item {\bf Student Helper:} Represented and presented the University in a real
    and positive view to both students interested in higher education and their parents. 
      \end{itemize}
\vspace{-3mm}
    The outcome was a big bonus for me as both activities shaped me into a better person, an empathetic person, able to relate and
    help others with their issues.
